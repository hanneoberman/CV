I am very passionate about 'dull' or 'difficult' topics such as statistics, programming, and philosophy of science. I'm motivated to use my enthusiasm and expertise to improve the quality of academic research and education. I aspire to (help others to) solve complex real-world problems that require insights from many disciplines and methodologies.

## Experience

[2023-current]{.aside}

* PhD candidate [Methodology and Statistics](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/methodology-and-statistics) \| Utrecht University \| Utrecht, The Netherlands

<!-- My aim is to develop interactive evaluation tools for incomplete data. Multiple imputation (Rubin, 1976) is a state-of-the-art technique for drawing valid conclusions from incomplete data, and is increasingly used in incomplete data analysis in many substantive fields. The R package mice (van Buuren & Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011) has become the de facto standard for the statistical analysis of incomplete data.  -->
<!-- With this project, we will connect applied researchers to statisticians by forming a bridge between the computational elements in computer science, data visualization, and inferential statistics. We do so by extending and improving the iterative multiple imputation framework such that applied researchers and advanced users can utilize it and can interpret its validity.  -->

<!-- The aim is to develop shinymice: computer-assisted model building and evaluation for multiple imputation. shinymice is an interactive and dynamic model building and evaluation device for multiple imputation that guides users through model building and evaluation. Building imputation models and evaluating the drawn imputations in terms of statistical validity is challenging for people without a thorough training. shinymice solves this by aiding users in building and evaluating their imputation and non-response models.  -->

<!-- The project aims will be achieved by investigating, evaluating, and implementing methods and data visualization tools for incomplete data analysis. -->
