I am very passionate about 'dull' or 'difficult' topics such as statistics, programming, and philosophy of science. I'm motivated to use my enthusiasm and expertise to improve the quality of academic research and education. I aspire to (help others to) solve complex real-world problems that require insights from many disciplines and methodologies.

## Teaching and supervision

I am passionate about teaching and in the process of obtaining a university teaching qualification ('BKO'). I'm most proud of my work as a thesis supervisor for the Master's programmes 'Methodology and Statistics for the Behavioural, Biomedical and Social Sciences' and 'Applied Data Science'. I enjoy teaching a wide range of topics, from introductory statistics to advanced data science, and from qualitative research methodology to the topic of my PhD: missing data methodology. 


## Conferences and events

I have presented at 14 conferences thus far (including poster presentations). My most impactful conference output has been the recording of a tutorial I gave at the [useR! 2024 conference](https://youtu.be/MTHgZNB5Wxw) on missing data exploration, imputation, and evaluation. My favorite event that I co-organized was a symposium about open science and qualitative research for the [Open Science Community Utrecht](https://openscience-utrecht.com/events/qualitative-research/), even though I did not present anything myself.
